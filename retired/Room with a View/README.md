## Challenge Description
I think that one of the most interesting aspects of humanity is our diverse attitudes about death. Common responses are fear and addness, but that's not always true. Some regard it with awe, wonder, or even joy. On the other hand, it does no good to dwell. Life is for living, after all. Gallows humor is a common way to cope, as our subject today shows. Below is a car. The person driving it is the leader of a very unusual club. If you can find the name of the club, convert it to the flag using the mapping in the contest rules and submit it.
