## Challenge Description
This challenge is a bit of a trial run. I had an idea this summer for a live forensics challenge using a running client. Well, here it is. The link below will get you a client. The flag is not in the client itself, but when you run it, it'll fetch the flag and load it into memory. A debugger or live memory forensics will get to it.
