## Challenge Description
Today you're going on an adventure across the high seas. It's actually kind of a fairy tale, so let's do it right... Once upon a time, there was a group of wealthy investors that dreamed of creating their very own paradise. They travelled to the lands of the Thai. At 7°29'22.2"N 98°34'48.6"E, to be exact. Except they were banished. So they tried again. They bought a ship and decided to forever sail the seas. Except that failed, too. The moral of the story: Money might buy many things, but it can't buy sovereignty. Yet. The ship is your target. The flag is the ships original name. Convert it to the format specified in the contest rules.
