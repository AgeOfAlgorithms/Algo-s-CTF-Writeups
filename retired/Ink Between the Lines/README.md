## Challenge Description
Sweet Gentlepersons, I have forsaken my life as a humble educator and have decided henceforth to become a bard. I am certain you will agree that I have what it takes when you witness my genius, thusly. Now, I am certain that you will doubt that it is my own creation. So, to eschew any accusations, I provide you a commemorative copy of this poem, secured and verified by digital means.
