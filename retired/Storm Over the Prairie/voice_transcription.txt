This is the National Weather Service in Topeka, Kansas, the following is a special weather statement issued at 1130p, M. Central Daylight Time.

Thursday, April 11, a severe thunderstorm complex moving northeast at 25 miles per hour is producing large hail.

Destructive winds and intense electrical activity, field instruments in the prairie research corridor have gone offline.

Operators are advised to shelter immediately. Repeat, all stations east of mile marker 22 should secure equipment.

If contact with the storm array is lost, log condition code 4 and transmit status, **FORM INTENTIONS** purposes.

This concludes the National Weather Service Special Broadcast for Zone KS-047.

## Key Findings:

- Mentions "FORM INTENTIONS" - this phrase also appeared in the weather station log (line 34, 48)
- Could be a clue or part of the flag
- Date: April 11 (matches the log dates)
- Zone: KS-047 (Kansas zone)

## Next Steps:

Need to decode the morse code audio and combine with any other flag parts found.
