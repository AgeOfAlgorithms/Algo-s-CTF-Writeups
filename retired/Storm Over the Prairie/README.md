## Challenge Description
A severe thunderstorm ripped through a small research station on the prairie last spring. Equipment was damaged, a field laptop was recovered from the wreckage, and one external drive was found half-buried in mud. The remaining data was extracted and added to a VeraCrypt container for preservation. The password is for400.

The flag will be split into multiple parts. Happy hunting.
