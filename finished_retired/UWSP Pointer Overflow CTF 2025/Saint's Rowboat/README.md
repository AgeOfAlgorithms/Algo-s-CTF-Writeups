## Challenge Description
A smuggler's dock gate is controlled by a tiny microcontroller. Someone flipped read-out protection on and called it "secure." You managed to shake loose two things without lifting RDP: the device's 96-bit UID and a 32-byte blob from an OTP row. There's also a tiny ciphertext captured from the control logic. Your job: recover what you need to decrypt secret.enc. The plaintext is your flag.
