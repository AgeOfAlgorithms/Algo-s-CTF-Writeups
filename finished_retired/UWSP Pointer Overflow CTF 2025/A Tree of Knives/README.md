## Challenge Description
This challenge began as a totally different idea. It was going to be a 300-level challenge with bin patching and a protected service, and all kinds of trouble to get to the flag. In the end, it just didn't make the cut. However, rather than ditch the whole idea, I figured we could nerf it down a little and make it an easy Reverse challenge. All the extra spaghetti code makes a nice distraction from what is otherwise a straight-forward effort.
