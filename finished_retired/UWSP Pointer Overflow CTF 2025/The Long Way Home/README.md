## Challenge Description
AI has gone too far... All I was trying to do was to create a virtual assistant to use for taking notes, and it developed some kind of multiple-personality disorder! It all started when it got depressed. I tried to fix it, and the thing flips to some kind of yandere waifu personality! Now it's totally random which one I have to deal with every time I try to use the thing. I've decided to scrap it, but keep that to yourself. In the meantime, let's use it as a target for an epxloit challenge. This one is much easier than in might seem at first, but they key, of course, is to work out the right angle.
