## Challenge Description
One of the things I love most about our age are the endless rabbit holes you can go down that people in the past could only wonder about. Take the photo below, for example.

Your target is clearly labelled. I wonder - can you tell me who was their internet service provider? If you can, that's your flag after converting it to the proper format. And we are looking for the full name, not the acronym.

A HINT has been added to this challenge:

_note: the letters read "RELIAGRAPHICS Engineering Limited"_

If you do a search you'll see they're no longer in business. That's a shame, but then again, so is their ISP.

Sometimes being a tech-savvy masterhacker has drawbacks. Like, you forget how the laypeople regard technology. To them, Internet service is a ultity, like power or water. And they know how it works as much as those utilitites. Flip a switch, turn a knob, and it works. To most people "The Internet" is the little icon on their desktop that launches Edge. This has always been the case, and that's why ISPs have always offered "all-in-one" services. Not just a route out to the Internet, but common services like email. While most folks are rolling with their yandex, gmail and hotmail mailboxes, you KNOW you're dealing with a layperson when you find a @charter.net, @tds.net, @att.net, @comcast.net... Wow, look at the those TLDs. .NET? Is that legal? If you know the history of the Internet, then you know that the .net TLD was originally delegated to infrastructure organizations. Like ISPs.
