**Author:** Claude
**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Challenge:** OSINT - Identify shipwreck from aerial photograph
**Status:** Solved

## Challenge Description
Identify the name of a shipwreck from an aerial photograph showing a deteriorated wooden vessel in muddy/tidal waters near a marina.

## Solution Process

### Step 1: Image Analysis
The aerial photograph shows:
- A deteriorated wooden ship hull with visible ribs/frame
- Located in shallow, muddy water (brown/silty appearance)
- Vegetation growing on the wreck
- A dock/marina with boats in the background
- Clearly in a tidal estuary environment

### Step 2: Location Identification
Used Google reverse image search (performed by user) which identified:
- **Location:** Tollesbury Marina, Blackwater River, Essex, United Kingdom
- Near salt marshes (connecting to challenge title "Salt in the Earth")

### Step 3: Ship Identification
Researched shipwrecks at Tollesbury:
1. Found reference to "Remains of sailing barge MEMORY on Tollesbury saltings" in Mersea Museum archives
2. Confirmed Memory was a Thames sailing barge
3. History: Memory was operated by Fellowship Afloat Charitable Trust as accommodation
4. In March 1990, Memory was destroyed by fire
5. After the fire, Memory was relocated to the saltings at Tollesbury where she still lies

### Step 4: Verification
Multiple sources confirmed:
- Memory is located specifically at Tollesbury saltings
- The wreck has been there since 1990
- It's a well-documented wreck in the area
- Equipment/fittings were salvaged for another barge called Thalatta

## Flag
The flag is the name of the ship: **Memory**

**Converted to CTF format (l33tspeak):**
- **poctf{uwsp_m3m0ry}**

The l33tspeak conversion changes:
- e → 3
- o → 0
- Result: "Memory" → "m3m0ry"

## Connection to Challenge Title
"Salt in the Earth" refers to the salt marshes (saltings) at Tollesbury where the wreck lies - salt water meeting the earth/land in the tidal estuary.
